# oop-class
This repository holds all the projects and homework from my OOP class. 

* There will be a subproject for each one of the class activities/projects. 
* Each one of the subprojects will have its own branch and will be merged into main upon completion.  


### Instructions

## Create a new subproject: 
1. Copy 00_project_template to the root directory. 
2. Rename the copy to XX_"project_name". 
3. Configure CMakelists.txt with project name and description. 


## Compiling the subproject: 
*Prerequisites:*
* Ninja

* GNU toolchain. 

1. Navigate to xx_project_name/Bld
2. Run "cmake..\ -G"Ninja" " on the CLI. 
3. Run the command "ninja" on the CLI. 
4. Executable file should be available on Bld.
